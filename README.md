SMood uses the power of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence, to gauge the market sentiment of a stock in financial markets. It analyzes the news headlines from various sources and predicts the “mood” of a market. A positive sentiment reflects the market is bullish, or has an optimistic outlook. Conversely, a negative sentiment reflects the bearish or pessimistic outlook of the market, expecting a drop in stock prices. If the sentiment does not change, it reflects the neutral nature of a stock’s market position. This can help those working in the finance or business domain to make informed decisions.
