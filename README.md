# SMOOD
SMood is a sentiment analysis web application for S&P 500 stocks using PyTorch, Transformers, React, Axios and Redux.
## Introduction
In today's dynamic financial world, staying ahead in the stock market requires a lot of different skills. It demands insight of previous trends, foresight on future trends, and an understanding of the market sentiment. To make the task a lot more easier, we introduce **SMOOD**, a comprehensive stock sentiment analysis app designed to aid investors, market analysts, researchers, businesses and financial advisors with practical insights derived from the collective mood of the market.

SMood uses the power of FinBERT, a LLM and an extension of the BERT model for financial tasks to gauge the market sentiment of a stock in financial markets. It analyzes the news headlines from various sources and predicts the **“mood”** of a market. A positive sentiment reflects the market is bullish, or has an optimistic outlook. Conversely, a negative sentiment reflects the bearish or pessimistic outlook of the market, expecting a drop in stock prices. If the sentiment does not change, it reflects the neutral nature of a stock’s market position. This can help those working in the finance or business domain to make informed decisions.

## Problem Statement
In today’s ever-changing landscape of financial markets, accurately gauging and measuring market feedback is a crucial skill for any investor, financial advisor, trader or market researcher. However, since the advent of the internet the data has grown exponentially in size. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the vast majority of news, twitter posts and financial reports to make an accurate decision. Manual analysis of the data in this way can lead to errors, bias or overheads, because the nature of capital markets is dynamic and prone to change quickly. Hence, there is an ever-growing need for automated market sentiment analysis systems that can efficiently process and analyze large volumes of textual data to provide timely and actionable insights into market sentiment trends and their potential impact on market movements.
